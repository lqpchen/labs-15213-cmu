# README

This repo contains the lab assignments I'm doing for [15-213: Intro to Computer Systems](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15213-f15/www/schedule.html). Each lab is well designed to be interesting and challenging which helps you reinforce the concepts from the relevant chapters of the famous textbook CSAPP 3rd (which is expected to be read thoroughly maybe 2~3 times), and your systems level coding and debugging skills will also be well prepared for the more advanced courses later (OS, DB, Networking, Distributed Systems, etc.).

The classroom recordings can be found [here](https://scs.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx#folderID=%22b96d90ae-9871-4fae-91e2-b1627b43e25e%22) and the assignments can be downloaded [here](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/labs.html). 

(The malloc lab and the proxy lab are not finished yet.)
